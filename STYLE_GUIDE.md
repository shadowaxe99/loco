# Code Style Guidelines

This project follows the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide for Python code. Here are some key points:

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.

- **Line Length**: Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

- **Blank Lines**: Top-level functions and classes should be separated by two blank lines. Method definitions inside a class should be separated by one blank line.

- **Imports**: Imports should be on separate lines.

- **Whitespace**: Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:

    - Immediately inside parentheses, brackets or braces.

    - Immediately before a comma, semicolon, or colon.

- **Comments**: Comments should be complete sentences and should be used sparingly.
