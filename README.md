# The Day Ben 10 Couldn't Handle Donna Paulsen's Sarcasm and Lewis Litt's Mudding Antics

Welcome to the most exciting crossover event in the universe! Imagine if Ben 10, with his trusty Omnitrix, decided to take a break from fighting aliens and instead dived into the world of scheduling and personalization. And who better to guide him than the razor-sharp Donna Paulsen and the eccentric Lewis Litt from the legal drama Suits? That's exactly what this project is all about!

In this Python application, we're combining the adventurous spirit of Ben 10, the wit of Donna Paulsen, and the uniqueness of Lewis Litt to create a Google Calendar event like no other. You'll be prompted to enter details for a recurring event, which will then be created on your Google Calendar. But this isn't just any event - it's an event that's been through the wringer of alien technology, legal acumen, and a whole lot of mud.

So strap in, because we're about to embark on an intergalactic journey of scheduling and personalization. Here's everything you need to know:
