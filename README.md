# AI Agent Scheduler

The AI Agent Scheduler is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to efficiently manage and optimize your schedule. It leverages advanced technologies such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and various APIs to provide a seamless and interactive scheduling experience.

## Tech Stack

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Used to understand and interpret user input. This is implemented in the `nlp_processing.py` file.
- Machine Learning (ML): Used to analyze scheduling patterns, user preferences, and historical data to provide personalized scheduling recommendations. This is implemented in the `ml_model.py` file.
- Calendar Integration APIs: Used to integrate with popular calendar systems such as Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook. This is implemented in the `calendar_integration.py` file.
- User Interface (UI) Development: A simple UI is implemented using tkinter. This is implemented in the `ui_development.py` file.
- Data Storage and Management: SQLite is used for data storage and management. This is implemented in the `data_storage.py` file.

## Dependencies

The project has the following dependencies:

- nltk: Used for natural language processing.
- sklearn: Used for machine learning.
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- requests: Used for making HTTP requests.
- sqlite3: Used for database management.
- tkinter: Used for creating the user interface.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the application, navigate to the src directory and run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

## Data Pathway for User Input

1. The user input is first captured through the UI.
2. The input is then parsed using NLP techniques in `nlp_processing.py`.
3. The parsed input is used to select features and define personalization options.
4. The AI Agent Scheduler then generates an optimized schedule using ML algorithms.
5. The schedule is synced with the user's calendar using the calendar integration APIs.
6. The updated schedule is displayed on the UI and stored in the database.

## Future Work

The following files still need to be created:

- feature_selection.py
- integration_points.py
- personalization_options.py
- continuous_learning.py
- privacy_security.py
- utils.py

And also the test files in the 'tests' directory.

## Deployment

The application is currently designed to run locally. For deployment, the SQLite database could be replaced with a server-based database system like PostgreSQL. The application could be containerized using Docker for easier deployment and scalability. The UI could also be enhanced for a better user experience.# loco
