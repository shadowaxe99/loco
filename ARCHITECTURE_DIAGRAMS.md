# Data Flow Diagrams

Data flow diagrams provide a visual representation of how data flows through the application. They can be very helpful in understanding the overall system architecture.

Unfortunately, as a text-based AI, I'm unable to create visual diagrams. However, I can describe what the data flow might look like in this application:

1. **User Input**: The application starts by collecting user input through the command line. This includes details for a recurring event.

2. **Google Calendar API**: The application interacts with the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events and create a new recurring event. The API returns data about the events.

3. **Data Processing**: The application processes the data returned by the API. This might involve parsing the data, selecting relevant features, and determining integration points.

4. **Output**: The application outputs the result to the user. This might involve updating the user interface with the new event details.

For a more detailed and accurate data flow diagram, I recommend using a diagramming tool like [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/), [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/), or [Microsoft Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software).
